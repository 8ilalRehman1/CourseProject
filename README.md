# Course Project
Final Project For Intro To Computer Graphics Bilal Rehman 100921929 This is my READ ME for the game. The game is in 2022.3.9f1 unity version. I have been using the Shader Lab to program the different shaders. The project template is the 3D Built-in render pipeline I used this pipeline as I think this is the most efficient pipeline. FOR BUMP MAPPING AND NORMAL MAPPING I USED THE IMAGES PROVIDED BY https://3dtextures.me/ BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GREYSCALE IMAGE, IMAGES USED FROM https://3dtextures.me/ are the Roof Bricks Fur Water. FOR BACKGROUND IMAGE I GOT IT FROM https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/345 BECAUSE I CANNOT MAKE A GOOD LOOKING IMAGE OF A CITY USED ON THE WALLS FOR THE FLOOR I USED A GRASS IMAGE FROM https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/abstract-green-background-with-vintage-grunge-background-texture-green-paper_25202238.htm BECAUSE I WANTED SOMETHING LOW RES I WANTED SOMETHING LOW RES BECAUSE MY PROJECT WAS TOO BIG For GIT HUB. 

Colour Grading was used for the basketball because i felt like this was the best use for the colour correction. This shader code changes the color of an object by applying a tint and an image texture to it. This helps to make objects in a game look more interesting and customized. Lambert lighting was used on the coin. I used it on the coin because the coin is dynamic and having a dynamic object shows the lighting shader better then non-dynamic objects. This shader code is for making objects in a game look properly lit. It takes the color you specify and calculates how light hits the object based on its surface angle and light direction. The world to object matrix helps convert the object's surface details to match the game's world, ensuring the lighting effects look accurate and realistic. 
Scrolling Texture has been implemented as a river, This makes the mose amount of sense as a river has a natural scroll to it. This shader code in Unity creates a scrolling texture effect, often used to simulate flowing water or moving clouds. It uses two textures: a main texture (_MainTex) and a foam texture (_FoamTex). The properties _ScrollX and _ScrollY control the speed and direction of the scrolling. In the shader, the texture coordinates are dynamically adjusted over time, making the textures appear to move. The surf function blends the two textures by scrolling them at different speeds, which adds a sense of depth and realism to the visual effect. The result is an animated surface that looks like it has a moving texture, enhancing the overall appearance of the material. 
Decals has been placed on the door, the main tex is the door and the decal is the stained glass. I put the stained glass as the decal because the picture of the door already had a window so i decided to change that with the stained glass decal. This shader code in Unity allows a texture (main image) to be blended with a decal (overlay image) based on a toggle switch. When the toggle showDecal is enabled, the shader multiplies the decal texture's visibility with its intensity. The main texture or decal texture is applied to the surface depending on the red color value of the decal, creating an effect where the decal appears only if its red component is strong enough. This can be useful for adding details like graffiti or stained glass to surfaces in a game.
Ambient lighting was placed on the spider for the same reason as the coin, dynamic object show the lighting better espcially with shadows. This Unity shader code is designed to simulate ambient lighting on a 3D object. It takes a base color and calculates how light interacts with the object's surface. The vertex function (vert) computes the direction of light and the object's normal vector to determine the intensity of the light that hits the surface. It then combines this diffuse reflection with ambient light to produce a final color. The fragment function (frag) outputs this color to display the lit object. Essentially, this shader enhances the visual realism of the object by accounting for both direct and ambient lighting effects. 
Specular Lighting is on the car body, Now cars are usually very shiny so i put the specular on the car. This Unity shader code creates a specular lighting effect, simulating shiny surfaces. It uses properties like color, specular color, and shininess to calculate how light reflects off an object. The vertex function vert prepares data for lighting calculations, transforming positions and normals. The fragment function frag then computes the lighting by combining diffuse and specular reflections. It considers the direction of light, the viewer's position, and the object's surface properties to produce realistic highlights. This enhances the visual realism by adding glints and reflections to the object's surface based on its material properties. 
I put rim lighting on the Car Wheels and and the sign. I saw this futuristic car with glowing wheels and decided to place the rim light on the wheels. Also wheels are also shiny but the outer rim is not so using a rim light helps show the difference from the out and inner wheel. I put it on the sign as the theme is spooky so i thought it would be cool to have a sort of effect on the sign, and the rim lighting makes the sign letters disapper which fits the spooky theme. This Unity shader code creates a rim lighting effect, which highlights the edges of an object based on the view direction. It calculates the rim light by taking the dot product of the normalized view direction and the object's normal, then uses this value to blend with the specified rim color. This makes the edges of the object glow, giving it a more defined and stylized appearance. 
For the windshield i places a hologram shader as in real life you are able to look through a windshield so it makes sense to place a hologram on the windows. This Unity shader code creates a hologram-like effect by applying rim lighting and transparency. It uses a rim color and rim power to calculate an outer glow based on the angle between the view direction and the surface normal. The glow is enhanced to make the object appear more holographic, while the alpha value is adjusted to add transparency, giving the object a translucent look. 
Bump and Normal Mapping was placed on the houses, bump and normal gives the look of texture without changing the geometry of the object so a roof and bricks has a lot of texture so placing a normal and bump is smart. This Unity shader code applies bump mapping to a surface, which gives it a more detailed and textured look. It uses a diffuse texture _myDiffuse for the base color and a bump texture _myBump to create the illusion of depth by adjusting the surface normals. The _mySlider property allows you to control the intensity of the bump effect, making the texture appear more or less pronounced. 
For toon shading i wasnt sure as to how to implement it so i thought that a tree has lots of shadows and details which is perfect for showing toon shading. and you can see this in the shadows of the trees. This Unity shader creates a cartoon-style effect on 3D objects by using a ramp texture to control the shading. It defines a custom lighting function that calculates the diffuse light and maps it through the ramp texture to produce sharp, stylized shading transitions, giving the object a toon-like appearance. The `surf` function applies the base color to the object, while the custom lighting function enhances the toon shading effect.
