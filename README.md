# Course Project
Final Project For Intro To Computer Graphics Bilal Rehman 100921929 This is my READ ME for the game. The game is in 2022.3.9f1 unity version. I have been using the Shader Lab to program the different shaders. The project template is the 3D Built-in render pipeline I used this pipeline as I think this is the most efficient pipeline. FOR BUMP MAPPING AND NORMAL MAPPING I USED THE IMAGES PROVIDED BY https://3dtextures.me/ BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GREYSCALE IMAGE, IMAGES USED FROM https://3dtextures.me/ are the Roof Bricks Fur Water. FOR BACKGROUND IMAGE I GOT IT FROM https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/345 BECAUSE I CANNOT MAKE A GOOD LOOKING IMAGE OF A CITY USED ON THE WALLS FOR THE FLOOR I USED A GRASS IMAGE FROM https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/abstract-green-background-with-vintage-grunge-background-texture-green-paper_25202238.htm BECAUSE I WANTED SOMETHING LOW RES I WANTED SOMETHING LOW RES BECAUSE MY PROJECT WAS TOO BIG For GIT HUB. Colour Grading was used for the basketball because i felt like this was the best use for the colour correction. This shader code changes the color of an object by applying a tint and an image texture to it. This helps to make objects in a game look more interesting and customized. Lambert lighting was used on the coin. I used it on the coin because the coin is dynamic and having a dynamic object shows the lighting shader better then non-dynamic objects. This shader code is for making objects in a game look properly lit. It takes the color you specify and calculates how light hits the object based on its surface angle and light direction. The world to object matrix helps convert the object's surface details to match the game's world, ensuring the lighting effects look accurate and realistic.
